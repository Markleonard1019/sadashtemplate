Dashboard Analyst Introduction
================
March 18, 2020

## Overview

Data dashboards provide a visual representation of hunting and fishing
license sales; summarizing both recent and long-term trends.
Participation metrics are presented for anglers and hunters as a whole
and also broken out over demographic groups, including residency,
gender, and age.

## Analyst Expectations

The data used to compile dashboards comes largely from state agency
databases; the analysis task involves preparing these idiosyncratic data
sources for dashboard production:

  - Connect to a Southwick server, accessed using Windows built-in VPN
    and Remote Desktop functionality.
  - Follow Southwick protocols to ensure security of sensitive data.
  - Adapt (or rewrite) template R scripts to process large data files
    (\~10+ million rows), utilizing available R resources to write and
    debug code.
  - Collaborate with project manager to accurately process/validate data
    and troubleshoot data challenges.

## Input: Raw License Data

State agencies provide raw license data, which is typically separated
into three related tables. A generic example:

### Data Processing Goals

  - Validate to ensure complete and accurate data
  - Summarize to get a sense for licensing trends and state-specific
    data peculiarities
  - Standardize to facilitate efficient workflows
  - Anonymize to remove sensitive information from production data
  - Create additional data categories to enable retrieval of customer
    trends

## Output: SQLite Database

The expected data processing output is superficially quite similar to
the data processing input, but is structured in a way which makes it
easy to extract participation metrics to build interactive dashboards:

## Example R Code

Iâ€™ve included some example R code (and output) below to give a sense of
what part of a workflow might look like:

  - Purpose: Ask a data question and answer using R
  - Question: How has the number of resident hunting licensed buyers
    changed year to year? In particular, what do the dynamics look like
    by age and gender?
