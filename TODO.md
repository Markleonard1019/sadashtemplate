Template files and documentation for national/regional dashboards

- make an R package (sadashtemplate) for populating template files
- function(s) for templating
    + probably best to write new functions (rather than using sadash) to make things simpler
- get template setup 
    + maybe populate inst/template as an R project that holds all the necessay files (.Rproj, renv, etc.). This should make it straightforward to (1) test template workflow and (2) write a function to populate files.
